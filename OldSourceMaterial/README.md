# DissertationWriting
This is the repo used for saving my dissertation writing work

This is the folder where you are storing the latest version of your dissertation writing.

As of right now, you are just using the writing skelton from the AAMAs conference.

moving over the original content to a different github repo in anticipation of actually doing some work

There is another folder named Dissertation Writing but that is what is holding the original AAMAS conference writing

But that is the writing that has been moved over into this folder and this is where I am going to be working from
