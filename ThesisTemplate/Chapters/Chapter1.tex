% "Autonomous robots are increasingly being applied to remote and hazardous environments [3,1], environments damage to sensory actuator systems cannot be easily repaired if damaged. An unsolved problem in the controller design for such autonomous robots is having controllers continue to effectively function given unexpected changes such as damage to robot morphology."

% "Currently, robotic systems recover from damage via self diagnosis and selection from pre-designed contingency plans in order to continue functioning [10,21,2]. Though robots using such self-diagnosis and recovery are problematic systems as they are expensive, requiring sophisticated monitoring sensors, and difficult to design as a priori knowledge of all necessary contingency plans is assumed [5]""

This was demonstrated as being akin to self-adaptation and injury recovery of animals observed in nature.""

% "This study further contributes to this research area, focussing on evolutionary controller design [11] within the broader context of collective [15] and swarm [1] robotics. That is, evolutionary controller design for robot groups that must continue to accomplish tasks given that damage is sustained to the morphologies of some or all of the robots in the group. ""

% ====================================================
The design and development of automated problem solvers and autonomous robots has long been a central theme of research in the crossover between artificial intelligence and robotics \cite{RefWorks:33}. However, given the levels of complexity and non-linearity of real-world problems, traditional methods of controller design have become impractical since they rely mostly on linear mathematical models \cite{RefWorks:32}. An additional consideration is that at a certain point, designing the problem solver becomes more difficult than solving the problem, especially when there is not a distinct and well-defined set of steps to follow in order to obtain the solution.

One such complex task, and the one being focussed on as the subject of this thesis, is that of achieving automated collective behaviour in which a team of autonomous agents must cooperate amongst themselves in order to accomplish a task. More specifically, this thesis will focus on collective robotics with a case study on the collective construction task

While it may be possible to to solve many complex tasks using a single sophisticated robot, there are several advantages to using collective robotics instead. Some of these advantages include being able to use much simpler designed robots in the team instead of one very expensive robot as well as having increased fault tolerance since there is no longer a single point of failure \cite{chaimowicz2001architecture}. The downside to a multi-agent team, however, is the infeasibility of designing the intricate dynamics inherent in producing self-organised behaviour between individuals by hand \cite{RefWorks:11}.

The collective construction task requires that a team of agents cooperate by coordinating their behaviours in order to assemble various structures within their environment \cite{NitschkeSaEC2012}. A group of autonomous agents (robots) are deployed into an unknown environment which they must explore in order to find resources and figure out how to assemble these resources in such a way as to create some structure, which can be completely predefined, or just according to some predefined structural criteria \cite{NitschkeSaEC2012}.

The ability to automate construction tasks through creating controllers for collective robotics presents several considerable benefits. Automation like this could be used to assist in projects such as producing low-cost housing in locations where resources are scarce, reducing high accident rates due to human error which is unfortunately unavoidable in traditional construction methods \cite{ShenKhoshnevis2003}. An additional possible application in the near future is to send multi-robot construction teams to extraterrestrial planets in order to build habitable structures in anticipation of humans arriving. These robot teams would also be useful in underwater construction which is extremely difficult and is one of the most dangerous jobs \cite{RefWorks:30}.

In an attempt to try and find a solution around the complexity of automating the design of these controllers, researchers turned to biological and natural processes for inspiration.

The problem solving power of evolution is abundantly clear in nature with the diverse range of organisms that exist (or ever have existed) on Earth, each specially designed for optimal survival in its own niche environment \cite{RefWorks:33}, making it unsurprising that computer scientists have resorted to researching natural processes for inspiration. 

One such approach that draws inspiration from Darwinian evolution is Evolutionary Algorithms which relates the fundamental metaphor of the evolutionary process to a simple style of problem solving, which is that of trial-and-error (also referred to as generate-and-test) \cite{RefWorks:33}.

Neuroevolution (NE) is a method of artificially evolving Artificial Neural Networks (ANN's) by implementing Evolutionary Algorithms to perform tasks such as evolving the network connection weights as well as the network topology \cite{Stanley2004, XinYao1999}.

It makes use of Evolutionary Algorithms in order to abstract the key aspects of the evolutionary process into a generational loop that will search for an optimal solution out of a population of candidates by evaluating each one in order to determine which is the fittest and thus the characteristics that persist to the next generation. Resulting in a stochastic search for the most optimal solution of the problem space.

It has been shown that NE cansuccessfully be applied to complex control tasks that require collective behaviour. These control tasks have no obvious mappings between the input from sensory configurations and motor outputs \cite{NitschkeSaEC2012}.




===============================================================
EDIT 1:
-----------------------
ADD SOME REAL WORLD EXAMPLES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF NE 
"NE is the main method for controller adaptation in evolutionary robotics (the overall topic that this thesis fits into) - and within this field - NE applied to collective robotics has achieved success (evolved effective group behaviours) to solve various collective behaviour tasks - then give several example tasks that evolutionary collective robotics systems have solved - with references"
==================================================================


One of the biggest issues to overcome in order to make these agents as robust as possible (and more suited to their inherently dangerous environments) is determining some way for the robots to be able to continue performing their required tasks despite any physical damage to their physical morphology that they may sustain. More specifically, with regards to their sensory input devices, which are integral to the functioning of any agent.


In fact, an open problem in \textit{collective} \cite{KubeZhang1994B} and \textit{swarm robotics} \cite{Beni2004}
is ascertaining appropriate sensory-motor configurations (morphologies) for robot teams that must work collectively given automatically generated controllers \cite{FloreanoDurrMattiussi2008}.


=====================================================================
EDIT 2:
----------------------------
'There should also be some mention of indirect vs direct encodings in NE - and mention examples of each (with references) - e.g. NEAT and HyperNEAT - pointing out the benefits of the latter (this is especially important since HyperNEAT is mentioned in your objectives and there needs to be some justification for using it)'

All of the information needed for the above edits (EDIT 1 and 2) is in the previous papers, especially the Honours literature reviews

=========================================================================



Current robotic systems make use self-diagnosis and selection from pre-designed contingency plans in order to be able to recover from damage and continue its normal functioning \cite{fenton2001fault, verma2004real, BongardZykovLipson2006}. However, robots that implemented this approach of self-diagnosis and recovery proved to be somewhat problematic in that these systems are relatively expensive and are difficult to design since it requires full \textit{a priori} knowledge of the system in order to design the contingency plans \cite{CullyCluneTaraporeMouret2015}.

Addressing this, recent work in \textit{Evolutionary Robotics} elucidated the efficacy of population based stochastic trial-and-error methods for online damage recovery in autonomous robots operating in physical environments \cite{CullyCluneTaraporeMouret2015}.
This was demonstrated as being akin to self-adaptation and injury recovery of animals observed in nature.

This study further contributes to this research area, focussing on \textit{evolutionary controller design} \cite{FloreanoDurrMattiussi2008} within the broader context of \textit{collective} \cite{KubeZhang1994B} and \textit{swarm} \cite{Beni2004} robotics.
That is, evolutionary controller design for robot groups that must continue to accomplish tasks given that damage is sustained to the morphologies of some or all of the robots in the group.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Given previous non-objective controller evolution work in collective robotics
\cite{gomes2013generic}
\cite{RefWorks:5}
\cite{RefWorks:11},
and previous research demonstrating the efficacy of \textit{novelty search} \cite{lehman2011abandoning} for evolving behaviours that operate across various robotic morphologies, the following research objectives formed the focus of this study;

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Novelty search behaviours out-perform those of objective serach in terms of average team task performance in increasingly complexy collective construction tasks.
	\item Novelty search is suitable for evolving morphologically robust controllers in collective construction tasks.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Another approach to this challenge draws inspiration from self-adaptation and injury recovery that has been observed in animals in nature.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Research Goals}

'The aims of this research project can be summarised as follows:'
\begin{itemize}
	\item 'To investigate the morphological robustness of multi-robot team controllers evolved using the HyperNEAT algorithm with respect sensory configurations when implemented in solving increasingly complex tasks requiring collective behaviour'
	\item 'building on the first, the second aim is to investigate the three different variations of the HyperNEAT algorithm by implementing various fitness functions'
\end{itemize}

"The complexity of the collective construction task is controlled by using a construction schema, which is implemented as a set of underlying connection rules. The level of cooperation is controlled by using the different types of resource blocks in the simulation.
The various levels are outlined as follows:"
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Level 1: no complexity or cooperation.
	\item Level 2: no complexity and some cooperation.
	\item Level 3: some complexity and some cooperation.
\end{enumerate}

We apply the HyperNEAT \cite{StanleyDAmbrosioGauci2009} neuro-evolution method to evolve
behavior for a range of morphologically homogenous teams that must solve various collective construction tasks.

This study's research objectives were formulated given results of the following previous related work. First, that non-objective based controller evolution has been effectively demonstrated in collective robotics \cite{RefWorks:11, gomes2013generic, RefWorks:5}.
Second, that Novelty Search has been demonstrated as suitable for evolving controllers (behaviours) that effectively operate across a range of robot morphologies






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Some additional input from the GECCO abstract %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To demonstrate the efficacy of Novelty Search (as compared to objective-based search) for evolving morphologically robust conrtollers over increasingly complex tasks.
	\item To demonstrate the efficacy of Novelty Search evolved behaviours versus those evolved by objective-based search in terms of average task performance (behaviour quality) over increasing task complexity
\end{enumerate}

To test these objectives, experiments evaluated various robot morphologies in an increasing complex collective construction task. 
That is, morphological robustness of evolved controllers was evaluated in terms of a controller's task performance coupled with alternate robot morphologies.

This study's contribution was thus to elucidate the impact of specific objective versus non-objective search methods on the evolution of \textit{morphologically robust} controllers in collective robotic systems. 
To date, the morphological robustness of such controller evolution approaches has not been comparatively evaluated, especially in the context of collective robotics. 
Specifically, collective robotic systems that must adapt to unforeseen morphological change, such as the loss or damage of sensors on one of more robots without significant task performance degradation \cite{BongardZykovLipson2006} \cite{CullyCluneTaraporeMouret2015}


\subsection{Contributions}




\subsection{Scope}

This dissertation is mainly focussed on exploring the ability of the HyperNEAT algorithm to produce homogenous multi-agent ANN controllers which are robust to changes in their sensory input morphology. That is to say, whether or not a team of evolved controllers/agents are able to still accomplish the task for which they were trained despite having sustained damage to their input sensors in some way.

Due to the large variety of approaches and parameter tuning abilities when it comes to Neuroevolution methods, we have chosen to focus specifically on the following search functions combined with indirect encoding method of NEAT, called HyperNEAT:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Objective Search
	\item Novelty Search
	\item Hybrid Search
\end{itemize}

Additionally, these experiments will be implemented using a predetermined collection of sensors that are either arranged in different physical locations on the robot or disabled to simulate damage.  The two distinctive facets of the evaluations is that the controllers are re-implemented using different morphologies as well as an additional evaluation where the sensors are randomly activated/deactivated.
