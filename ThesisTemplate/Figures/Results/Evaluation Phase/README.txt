The Re-Evaluation figures are calculated as an average over all 4 re-evaluation runs.

So, evaluation run = implementing most successful controller in simulation with its original morph for 20 runs in order to get a base score
Re-evaluation = implementing the successful controller in simulator across various morphs.

Controller_1 Re-Eval Score = (C1M2 + C1M3 + C1M4 + C1M5)/4
this is repeated for each controller.

Essentially, each controller is re-evaluated across all morphs and an average value is then found from these. This average value is what is plotted in these figures.

There are also respective figures which show a controllers results for each respective morph re-evaluation.
These are found in the Appendix folder
